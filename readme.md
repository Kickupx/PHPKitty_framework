# About PHPKitty web frontend

Made for artisans by giving introspection abilities to templates. More clearly this allows less backend programming.
By allowing PHP modules to connect to templates directly and by using the primitives user permissions and routes more specific
modules can written and reused everywhere with very little PHP. An example would be a facebook module collection.
There it could be modules Facebook.login and Facebook.user which values can be presented on a template with only a few
PHP lines.
